## 📰 Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying and classifying news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. With the rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms, this system aims to provide an automated and efficient solution to detect unreliable news content.

### 🔍 Project Overview

The model analyzes news text data, extracts meaningful features, and applies supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the authenticity of news articles. It is trained on labeled datasets containing real and fake news samples.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer
* Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### ✨ Key Features

* Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
* Feature extraction using NLP techniques
* Accurate classification of news as **Fake** or **Real**
* Easy-to-understand and modular code structure
* Can be extended to real-time news detection systems
